# Review: Layout

Great job! In this lesson, you learned how to control the positioning of elements on a web page.

**Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:**

1. The `position` property allows you to specify the position of an element in three different ways.

2. When set to `relative`, an element’s position is relative to its default position on the page.

3. When set to `absolute`, an element’s position is relative to its closest positioned parent element. It can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move with the rest of the document when the page is scrolled.

4. When set to `fixed`, an element’s position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.

5. The `z-index` of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page when it overlaps other elements.

6. The `display` property allows you control how an element flows vertically and horizontally a document.

7. `inline` elements take up as little space as possible, and they cannot have manually-adjusted width or height.

8. `block` elements take up the width of their container and can have manually-adjusted heights.

9. `inline-block` elements can have set width and height, but they can also appear next to each other and do not take up their entire container width.

10. The `float` property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.

11. You can clear an element’s left or right side (or both) using the `clear` property.

12. When combined with an understanding of the box model, `positioning` can create visually appealing web pages. So far, we’ve focused on adding content in the form of text to a web page. 

In the next unit, you’ll learn how to add and manipulate images to a web page.
