# Review

Great job! You learned how to style an important aspect of the user experience, typography.

**Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:**

* *Typography* is the art of arranging text on a page.

* Text can appear in any number of weights, with the `font-weight` property.

* Text can appear in italics with the `font-style` property.

* The vertical spacing between lines of text can be modified with the `line-height` property.

* *Serif* fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. `Sans-Serif` fonts do not.

* *Fallback fonts* are used when a certain font is not installed on a user’s computer.

* Google Fonts provides free fonts that can be used in an HTML file with the `<link>` tag or the `@font-face` property.

* Local fonts can be added to a document with the `@font-face` property and the path to the font’s source.

* The `word-spacing` property changes how far apart individual words are.

* The `letter-spacing` property changes how far apart individual letters are.

* The `text-align` property changes the horizontal alignment of text.
