# Color Review

We’ve completed our extensive tour of the colors in CSS! Let’s review the key information we’ve learned.

**There are four ways to represent color in CSS:**

* Named colors — there are 147 named colors, which you can review [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).

* Hexadecimal or hex colors

  * Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”.
  * Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue and green using hexademical numbers such as `#23F41A`.
* RGB

  * RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.
  * RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: `rgb(7, 210, 50)`.
* HSL
  * HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).
  * Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: `hsl(200, 20%, 50%)`.
* You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, `a`, which is represented as a percentage.

Great job! Feel empowered to add a bit of color to each of your projects!
