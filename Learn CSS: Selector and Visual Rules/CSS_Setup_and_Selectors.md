# Review CSS Selectors

Throughout this lesson, you learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. Let’s review what you learned:

* CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.
* CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
* Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
* Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
* IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.
* Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
* Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
* The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.
* Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
* Great work this lesson. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to use CSS to change the look and feel of websites to make them look great.
