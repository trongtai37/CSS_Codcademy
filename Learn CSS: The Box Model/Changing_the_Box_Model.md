# Review: Changing the Box Model

In this lesson, you learned about an important limitation of the default box model: box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.

Letâ€™s review what you learned:

1. In the default box model, box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.

2. The `box-sizing` property controls the box model used by the browser.

3. The default value of the `box-sizing` property is `content-box`.

4. The value for the new box model is `border-box`.

5. The `border-box` model is not affected by border thickness or padding.
