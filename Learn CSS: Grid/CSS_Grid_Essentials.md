* `grid-template-columns` defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid

* `grid-template-rows` defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid

* `grid-template` is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in one line

* `grid-gap` puts blank space between rows and/or columns of the grid

* `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` makes elements span certain rows of the grid

* `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` makes elements span certain columns of the grid

* `grid-area` is a shorthand for `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end`, all in one line
