# Review

Great work! You have learned many new properties to use when creating a layout using CSS Grid! Let’s review:

* `grid-template-areas` specifies grid named grid areas

* grid layouts are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.

* `justify-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis

* `justify-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis

* `align-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis

* `align-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis

* `align-self` specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis

* `grid-auto-rows` specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid

* `grid-auto-columns` specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid

* `grid-auto-flow` specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created

This is a great time to experiment with the code in the code editor and try any of the properties you want to practice more! When you’re ready, move on!
